                  I grew up in the early 2000s, right into the world already
                  buzzing software devs and big tech companies. Since then I&apos;ve
                  been fascinated by technology, curious about how things work.
                  As a result, I spent years of my childhood learning about them,
                  fixing my computer, taking and apart hard drives. Thanks to Windows
                  XP & computer viruses I learnt the habit of fixing errors,
                  early in life.

                  I got into programming early in life with things like QBasic, PC Logo 
                  and Borland C++. I went from flashing whatever new ROM was cool then,
                  onto my old Android, to building a UI from scratch because the existing
                  one looked too boring.

                  Programming isn&apos;t just a subject, it&apos;s like a superpower.
                  Why search for a tool when you can build the toolbox? My work has 
                  always been a reflection of my interests and needs. From making a weather
                  application because my phone didn&apos;t come with one and other free
                  alternatives looked ugly, to building complex system to screenshare from 
                  my Mac to my Galaxy, I almost exclusively build things which solve
                  real problems.

                  In a world where everything is an app, I find myself wearing two hats. At
                  times, I&apos;m a consumer, navigating through the App Store. But more
                  often than not, I&apos;m a creator, ideating, designing and developing the
                  apps that I use.

              Right now, I&apos;m working as a Software Developer at Yamaha Motor
              India, where I&apos;ve been a part of 3 different teams spread across
              the world. Each of which taught me more than the previous. I&apos;ve
              led the development of smart, sensor-powered mobile applications.
              We&apos;re talking real-time driving detection, complex ployline
              algorithms, and even trip tracking natively using Bluetooth and GPS.
              I have written native code in Swift and Kotlin, wrangled Python event
              logics, and even migrated entire applications to Flutter for better performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before Yamaha, I have been an intern in multiple startups and organizations,
              where I worked on a variety of projects. I&apos;ve worked at DRDO, Hack2Skill,
              Coding Blocks, and other startups, where I was involved in everything from
              designing to developing end-to-end applications.

              Development isn&apos;t the only thing that drives me. I seldom freelance
              as a designer. I believe that design should whisper, not shout. I love apps
              that feel obvious in hindsight â€” the kind that makes you think, &quot;of course,
              this is how it should work.&quot;. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m sketching,

              The goal of every journey is to gain more entropy (the ability for
              life to be spontaneous) all I work for is to gain a little more
              entropy, that extra ability to indulge in my pursuits without
              having to think about the constraints. The core of humanly life
              has always been the pursuit of &quot;the more&quot; and I
              don&apos;t find myself very different here.

              startups, freelanced, shipped products, scrapped ideas, and walked away
              from what didn&apos;t align with my vision. It&apos;s part of the process.
              Change is the constant I&apos;ve come to admire â€” new tech, new cities, new people.
              That&apos;s how entropy, or what I call freedom to create, increases.
